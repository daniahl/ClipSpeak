What is ClipSpeak
=================
ClipSpeak is a portable, lightweight text-to-speech tool that speaks text copied to the clipboard. It is intended to be as transparent as possible to the user, keeping user interface and interaction to a minimum.
At this moment it simply uses the voice selected in the control panel's speech dialogue, but support is planned to allow voice selection in the program.

How to use it
=============
When you start ClipSpeak it will position itself in the system tray area. Now just select some text and copy it, and ClipSpeak will speak it.
To close ClipSpeak, right-click it's icon in the system tray and select Exit.
