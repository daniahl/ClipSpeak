What is ClipSpeak
=================
ClipSpeak is a portable, lightweight text-to-speech tool that speaks text copied to the clipboard. It is intended to be as transparent as possible to the user, keeping user interface and interaction to a minimum.


What is new and what is coming
==============================
New features in ClipSpeak 1.0:
* You can now stop speech (press the right control key).
* You can select which speech synthesizer ClipSpeak uses (check the right-click menu).
The next release will probably feature a "Save to MP3" function.

How to use it
=============
When you start ClipSpeak it will position itself in the system tray area. Now just select some text and copy it, and ClipSpeak will speak it.
To close ClipSpeak, right-click its icon in the system tray and select Exit. To stop ongoing speech, press the right control key.
If you want to select a different voice, you can do so in the voice selection dialog. Right-click on the ClipSpeak icon and select "Select voice" to reach it.
